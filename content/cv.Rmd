# Education

## Degrees

2018
  : **Bachelor's degree in statistics**, *Lund University*
  : I developed an algorithm for creating area-proportional Euler diagrams
    using ellipses. This work also resulted in a conference paper and
    oral presentation at the SetWR conference in Edinburgh.

2015 -- 2017
  : **Master’s degree in medical science with a major in physical therapy**,
    *Lund University*
  : In my masters thesis I design and piloted a randomized controlled trial.

2011 -- 2014
  : **Bachelor's degree in Physical  Therapy**, *Lund University*
  : For my bachelor thesis, me and my co-author traveled to Tokyo to interview
    physical therapists about their professional role and use of technology.
