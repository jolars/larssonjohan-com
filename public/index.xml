      <description>My R package qualpalr selects qualitative colors by projecting a bunch of colors (as points) to the three-dimensional DIN99d color space wherein the distance between any pair colors approximate their differences in appearance. The package then tries to choose the n colors so that the minimal pairwise distance among them is maximized, that is, we want the most similar pair of colors to be as dissimilar as possible.
This turns out to be much less trivial that one would suspect, which posts on Computational Science, MATLAB Central, Stack Overflow, and and Computer Science can attest to.</description>

      <description>eulerr is an R package that generates area-proportional euler diagrams to display set relationships (intersections, unions, and disjoints) with circles. Euler diagrams are Venn diagrams without the requirement that all set interactions be present (whether they are empty or not). That is, depending on input, eulerr will sometimes produce Venn diagrams but sometimes not.
Background R features a number of packages that produce euler and/or venn diagrams; some of the more prominent ones (on CRAN) are</description>

      <description>With the advent of colorbrewer there now exists good options to generate color palettes for sequential, diverging, and qualitative data. In R, these palettes can be accessed via the popular RColorBrewer package. Those palettes, however, are limited to a fixed number of colors. This isn’t much of a problem for sequential of diverging data since we can interpolate colors to any range we desire:</description>

      <description>Education Degrees  2018 Bachelor’s degree in statistics, Lund University  I developed an algorithm for creating area-proportional Euler diagrams using ellipses. This work also resulted in a conference paper and oral presentation at the SetWR conference in Edinburgh.  2015 – 2017 Master’s degree in medical science with a major in physical therapy, Lund University  In my masters thesis I design and piloted a randomized controlled trial.  2011 – 2014 Bachelor’s degree in Physical Therapy, Lund University  For my bachelor thesis, me and my co-author traveled to Tokyo to interview physical therapists about their professional role and use of technology.</description>
